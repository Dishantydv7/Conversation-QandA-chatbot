# GenAi

- In many Q&A applications we want to allow the user to have a back-and-forth conversation, meaning the application needs some sort of "memory" of past questions and answers, and some logic for incorporating those into its current thinking.

## We will cover two approaches:

- Chains, in which we always execute a retrieval step;
- Agents, in which we give an LLM discretion over whether and how to execute a retrieval step (or multiple steps).# Conversation-QandA-chatbot
